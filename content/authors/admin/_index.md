I am an assistant professor teaching stream (CLTA) at University of Toronto's [Department of Economics](http://www.economics.utoronto.ca). I teach empirical methods (econometrics, data analysis) and microeconomics.  Before joining University of Toronto, I worked at the [OECD](https://www.oecd.org), in particular on productivity dispersion and wage inequality.
