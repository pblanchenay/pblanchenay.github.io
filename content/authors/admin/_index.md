I teach empirical methods (econometrics, data analysis) and microeconomics at the University of Toronto (St-George and Scarborough campuses).  I have taught both in large classes (180+) and smaller classes, using a variety of methods. Before joining UofT, I worked at the [OECD](https://www.oecd.org), in particular on productivity dispersion and wage inequality.
