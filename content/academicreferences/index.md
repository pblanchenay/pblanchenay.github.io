I am in general happy to write a reference letter for former students; however, it takes time. To make sure you know what you are asking, and whether it would actually help your application, here is some guidance. Please read in full.

{{% toc %}}

## Am I willing to write a letter for you?

* In general yes, but I reserve the right to refuse writing a letter for you (i.e. it's not guaranteed).
* If I refuse it is usually for one of these reasons:
	* I believe it would not help your application.
	* I do not have enough time before the deadline. **Allow 3 weeks before the nearest deadline.**
* If you have never *completed* a course with me, I am in general very reluctant to write for you. If you are a current student, I can only write if I have sufficient info about you, which is rare for current students.

## What do I put in the reference letter?

The goal of a reference letter is to provide accurate information about you to the selection committee. (It is not to get you into the program at all costs.)

- In any reference letter I will, at the minimum, mention the grade you received in my course, and how it compares to other students, current and past.
- I will also provide any type of information that I deemed relevant for the committee, elements that indicate how well you would do in the program, how motivated you are, how much you would benefit from the program, and how the program would benefit to have you as a student.
- I do not lie and I try to be honest and objective.
- Reference letters are confidential between myself and the selection committee.

## Should you ask me for a reference letter?

A reference letter will increase your chances if it can provide information about you that is 1/ positive, 2/  specific and credible, and 3/ relevant to the program you are applying to.

- If you didn't do really well in my course, it is in your interest to ask an instructor for a course you did particularly well in.
- If you took my course, but the only thing I know about you are your grades, the letter would not be very specific or informative. It might be in your interest to ask another instructor who knows you better.
- If you are applying to a program that is totally unrelated to the course you took with me, my letter will not be very relevant to the selection committee. You are better off asking an instructor that can comment on the skills/topics that are particularly relevant for that program.

## You have read all this and would like me to write a letter. What should you do?
- Make sure to contact me well in advance of deadlines. Most postgraduate programs have deadlines between early December to early February.
- **Allow three weeks before the earliest deadline.**
- Be ready to meet for a quick chat about your applications.
- Contact me by email (not in office hours). 
**Your email should contain:**	
	- [ ] Your name & student ID.
	- [ ] The following Excel file, renamed appropriately, filled in with the list of applications for which you want my reference letter: [NAME_FirstName_Programs_ApplicationLists.xlsx](../files/NAME_FirstName_Programs_ApplicationLists.xlsx)
	- [ ] A full up-to-date UofT academic transcript.
	- [ ] An up-to-date CV.
	- [ ] Any document (e.g. cover letter) that you wish to supply to the application process.

## What I will not do for you
* Lie or misrepresent information about your work.
* Check the content of your application.
